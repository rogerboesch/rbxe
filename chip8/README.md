# Chip-8 Emulator

*Work in progress*

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, which were 8-bit microcomputers made in the mid-1970s.

CHIP-8 was designed to be easy to program for and to use less memory than other programming languages like BASIC.
